From the log, it looks like your OpenVPN client successfully connected, but there are a few remaining warnings that should be addressed for security and compatibility:

---

### **1. Compression Warning (Security Risk)**

```plaintext
WARNING: Compression for receiving enabled. Compression has been used in the past to break encryption.
```

**Issue:** You have `comp-lzo` enabled, which is deprecated and insecure because it can be exploited for compression-based attacks like CRIME.

**Solution:** Disable compression entirely on both the server and client:

**Server:**

```plaintext
;comp-lzo
allow-compression no
```

**Client:**

```plaintext
;comp-lzo
```

If you must keep compression for legacy clients, explicitly enable it with:

```plaintext
allow-compression yes
```

---

### **2. Deprecated Cipher Warning**

```plaintext
DEPRECATED OPTION: --cipher set to 'AES-128-CBC' but missing in --data-ciphers
```

**Issue:** The server is still using the old `--cipher` directive without the modern `--data-ciphers` option.

**Solution:** Update both server and client configurations:

**Server (`server.conf`):**

```plaintext
data-ciphers AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM:AES-128-CBC
cipher AES-256-GCM
```

**Client (`client.conf`):**

```plaintext
data-ciphers AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM:AES-128-CBC
cipher AES-256-GCM
```

---

### **3. Topology Mismatch (Optional but Recommended)**

Your server is pushing a `net30` topology:

```plaintext
PUSH_REPLY,dhcp-option DNS 192.168.35.1,route 192.168.35.0 255.255.255.0,topology net30
```

**Issue:** `topology net30` is outdated and can cause routing problems with some clients.

**Solution:** Switch to the simpler and more efficient `topology subnet`:

**Server (`server.conf`):**

```plaintext
topology subnet
```

---

### **4. Interface Cleanup Warning**

```plaintext
/sbin/ifconfig utun4 delete
ifconfig: ioctl (SIOCDIFADDR): Can't assign requested address
```

**Issue:** This warning occurs because the address you are trying to delete from the `utun4` interface is not present. This is typically harmless but can indicate a stale state.

**Solution:** Ensure the TUN device is properly cleaned up between connections:

**Add this to your client config:**

```plaintext
persist-tun
persist-key
```

---

### **5. General Improvements (Security and Stability)**

**A. Server Config:**

Add:

```plaintext
tls-version-min 1.2
auth SHA256
remote-cert-tls server
```

Remove:

```plaintext
comp-lzo
```

**B. Client Config:**

Add:

```plaintext
auth-nocache
remote-cert-tls server
```

---

### **6. Final Recommended Configuration (Server and Client)**

**Server (`server.conf`):**

```plaintext
mode server
proto udp
tls-server
dev tun
topology subnet
server 192.168.35.0 255.255.255.0
port 1194

```

**Client (`client.conf`):**

```plaintext
remote vpn.jakub.bsa
tls-client
port 1194
proto udp
dev tun
pull

data-ciphers AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM:AES-128-CBC
