#### **/etc/fstab (File System Mount Table)**

**Purpose:**

* **/etc/fstab** is used to define and automate the mounting of filesystems at boot time.

**Key Features:**

* Controls mount points, mount options, and filesystem checks.
* Supports a wide range of filesystems, including **ext4**, **btrfs**, **xfs**, **nfs**, and decrypted devices from **crypttab**.

**Typical Format:**

```bash
<device> <mountpoint> <fstype> <options> <dump> <pass>
```

**Example Entry:**

```bash
/dev/mapper/cryptdisk1 /mnt/secure ext4 defaults 0 2
UUID=1234-5678 /data ext4 defaults,noatime 0 2
```

**Field Breakdown:**

* **device:** The block device or UUID (can reference **/dev/mapper** for encrypted volumes).
* **mountpoint:** Directory where the partition will be mounted.
* **fstype:** Filesystem type (e.g., ext4, xfs, btrfs, nfs).
* **options:** Mount options like **defaults**, **noatime**, **ro**, **rw**.
* **dump:** Used by **dump** command, usually 0.
* **pass:** Filesystem check order at boot (0 = no check, 1 = root, 2 = others).

**Key Considerations:**

* **Mount Order:** Be careful with dependencies, especially for encrypted partitions.
* **UUIDs vs Device Paths:** Using **UUIDs** is more reliable as device names can change.

### **Combining crypttab and fstab:**

When using encrypted partitions, you often need both files:

1. **/etc/crypttab** (decrypt the device)

```bash
cryptdisk1 /dev/sda5 /etc/keys/disk.key luks
```
2. **/etc/fstab** (mount the decrypted device)

```bash
/dev/mapper/cryptdisk1 /mnt/secure ext4 defaults 0 2
```

### **Practical Example (Encrypted Home Directory)**

**/etc/crypttab:**

```bash
crypt-home /dev/sdb2 none luks
```

**/etc/fstab:**

```bash
/dev/mapper/crypt-home /home ext4 defaults 0 2
```

---

### **Testing and Verification:**

* **Manually Open Encrypted Device:**

  ```bash
  sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda5 cryptdisk1
  ```
* **Verify Mounting:**

  ```bash
  sudo mount /dev/mapper/cryptdisk1 /mnt/secure
  ```
* **Check Status:**

  ```bash
  sudo cryptsetup -v status cryptdisk1
  ```

---

### **Security Note:**

* Always ensure the key files are securely stored, and consider using **YubiKey**, **TPM**, or **HSM** for better security.
* Avoid storing key files on the same drive as the encrypted partition, if possible.
