To allow specific IP addresses and deny the rest using `iptables`, you need to create rules that explicitly allow the trusted IPs before setting a default "deny all" policy. Here's a simple approach:

### **Basic Steps:**

1. **Allow Specific IPs:**

   ```bash
   sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.100 -j ACCEPT
   sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.101 -j ACCEPT
   ```

   Replace `192.168.1.100` and `192.168.1.101` with the IPs you want to allow.

2. **Set a Default Drop Policy:**

   ```bash
   sudo iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
   ```

### **Complete Example:**

```bash
sudo iptables -F  # Clear all existing rules

# Allow traffic from specific IPs
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.100 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.101 -j ACCEPT

# Allow localhost (important for internal communication)
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 127.0.0.1 -j ACCEPT

# Allow related and established connections
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

# Drop everything else
sudo iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
```

### **Save the Rules:**

To make these changes persistent across reboots, you need to save them:

**Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

**CentOS/RHEL:**

```bash
sudo service iptables save
```

### **Verify the Rules:**

You can check the active rules with:

```bash
sudo iptables -L -v -n
```
