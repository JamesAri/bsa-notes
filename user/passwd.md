#### **Checking Password Status:**

* To see the current status of a user’s password:

```bash
sudo passwd -S username
```

**Example Output:**

```plaintext
alice P 12/23/2024 0 99999 7 -1 (Password set, never expires)
```

* **Status Codes:**

  * **P** – Password set.
  * **L** – Locked account.
  * **NP** – No password set.

#### **Password Aging Settings:**

To control password aging more precisely, you can also use the `chage` command:

* Set a password to expire in 30 days:

```bash
sudo chage -M 30 username
```

* Set the account expiration date:

```bash
sudo chage -E 2025-12-31 username
```

---

#### **Security Considerations:**

* Always use strong passwords.
* Avoid using the `-d` option unless absolutely necessary.
* Lock accounts that are no longer in use.
* Use `faillog` to limit login attempts for added security.
