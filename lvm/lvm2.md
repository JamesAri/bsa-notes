### **Key Concepts in LVM2:**

1. **Physical Volume (PV):**

* The physical storage device or partition where the LVM will operate.
* Examples include entire disks (e.g., /dev/sdb) or specific partitions (e.g., /dev/sdb1).

2. **Volume Group (VG):**

* A collection of one or more Physical Volumes that form a single pool of storage.
* VGs are the foundation for creating Logical Volumes.
* Example: `vgcreate myvg /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1`

3. **Logical Volume (LV):**

* A virtual partition carved out of the available space in a Volume Group.
* You can resize, snapshot, and move LVs without being constrained by physical disk layout.
* Example: `lvcreate -L 20G -n mylv myvg`

4. **Physical Extents (PE) and Logical Extents (LE):**

* LVM breaks down each PV into small, fixed-size chunks called Physical Extents (PEs), which are then used to allocate space for LVs.
* The size of these extents is typically 4MB but can be customized.


### **Basic Commands:**

* **Create a Physical Volume:** `pvcreate /dev/sdb1`
* **Create a Volume Group:** `vgcreate myvg /dev/sdb1`
* **Create a Logical Volume:** `lvcreate -L 10G -n mylv myvg`
* **Extend a Logical Volume:** `lvextend -L +5G /dev/myvg/mylv`
* **Resize the Filesystem:** `resize2fs /dev/myvg/mylv`
* **Display LVM Information:**

  * `pvs` - List physical volumes.
  * `vgs` - List volume groups.
  * `lvs` - List logical volumes.



The command:

```bash
losetup /dev/loop0 /tmp/lvm_test.img
```

**Purpose:**

This command links a regular file (`/tmp/lvm_test.img`) to a loopback device (`/dev/loop0`), effectively making the file act like a real block device (like a physical disk).

### **Why Use a Loop Device for LVM Testing?**

1. **Safe Testing Environment:**

* It allows you to test LVM without modifying real disks or partitions, reducing the risk of data loss.

2. **Flexible Disk Simulation:**

* You can simulate various storage scenarios, like adding or removing "disks," without physically changing your hardware.

3. **Low Resource Overhead:**

* Creating and attaching loop devices is fast and consumes minimal system resources compared to spinning up virtual machines.

4. **Realistic LVM Practice:**

* You get hands-on practice with commands like `pvcreate`, `vgcreate`, and `lvcreate` without needing physical disks.

### **How It Works:**

* **The File (`/tmp/lvm_test.img`)** – Acts as the storage medium.
* **The Loop Device (`/dev/loop0`)** – Provides a block device interface, allowing the file to be used like a physical hard drive.

### **Example Workflow:**

Once attached, the loop device can be used with standard disk utilities:

```bash
# View the loop device details
losetup -l

# Create a partition table if needed
fdisk /dev/loop0

# Create a physical volume for LVM
pvcreate /dev/loop0
```

### **Block Devices for LVM:**

1. **loop devices (`loop0` to `loop7`)**

* These are virtual block devices that you can associate with a file, making it act like a real disk.
* Useful for creating LVM setups without touching real disks.
* Example: `/dev/loop0`

2. **VDA devices (`vda1`, `vda14`, `vda15`)**

* These are virtual block devices typically used in virtualized environments (like KVM/QEMU).
* They represent real block devices and can be used for testing if available.
* Example: `/dev/vda1`

### **Example Workflow with Loop Devices:**

1. **Create a Disk Image:**

```bash
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/lvm_test.img bs=1M count=1024
```

2. **Attach it to a Loop Device:**

```bash
losetup /dev/loop0 /tmp/lvm_test.img
```

3. **Create a Physical Volume (PV):**

```bash
pvcreate /dev/loop0
```

4. **Create a Volume Group (VG):**

```bash
vgcreate test_vg /dev/loop0
```

5. **Create a Logical Volume (LV):**

```bash
lvcreate -L 500M -n test_lv test_vg
```

6. **Format and Mount:**

```bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/test_vg/test_lv
mount /dev/test_vg/test_lv /mnt
```

7. **Cleanup (when done testing):**

```bash
umount /mnt
lvremove /dev/test_vg/test_lv
vgremove test_vg
pvremove /dev/loop0
losetup -d /dev/loop0
```
