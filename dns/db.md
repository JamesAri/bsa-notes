This is a **DNS zone file** for the **jindra.bsa.** domain, defining the essential records needed for the DNS server to resolve hostnames to IP addresses. Here's a detailed breakdown:

---

### **Header and SOA (Start of Authority) Record**

```plaintext
$TTL    604800
@   IN  SOA jindra.bsa. root.localhost. (
                  2     ; Serial / YYYYMMDDXX
             604800     ; Refresh / seconds
              86400     ; Retry / seconds
            2419200 ; Expire / seconds
             604800 )   ; Negative Cache TTL / explicitni TTL
```

1. **\$TTL 604800**

   * Sets the default Time-to-Live (TTL) for all records in the zone to **604800 seconds (7 days)** unless otherwise specified.
   * This controls how long DNS records are cached by other servers.

2. **SOA (Start of Authority) Record**

   * Identifies the authoritative server for this zone and includes essential timing and control parameters:
   * **Primary Name Server:** **jindra.bsa.** (the main DNS server for the domain)
   * **Responsible Email:** **root.localhost.** (actually **root\@localhost**, with the "@" replaced by a dot for DNS syntax)
   * **Serial Number (2)**

     * Incremented whenever the zone file is updated. Common formats are **YYYYMMDDXX** to track changes.
   * **Refresh (604800)**

     * How often secondary (slave) DNS servers should check for updates (7 days).
   * **Retry (86400)**

     * How often to retry if the master server is unavailable (1 day).
   * **Expire (2419200)**

     * How long the zone data is valid without contact with the master server (28 days).
   * **Negative Cache TTL (604800)**

     * How long a server should cache a "no record found" response (7 days).

### **Name Server (NS) Records**

```plaintext
@         IN      NS                ns.jindra.bsa.
@         IN      NS                lubos.bsa.
```

* **NS Records**

  * Define the authoritative name servers for the **jindra.bsa.** domain.
  * The **@** symbol is a shortcut for the domain name itself (**jindra.bsa.**).
  * **ns.jindra.bsa.** and **lubos.bsa.** are the designated DNS servers for this domain.

### **Address (A and AAAA) Records**

```plaintext
@         IN      A                 147.228.67.42
@         IN      A                 147.228.67.41
@         IN      AAAA              ::1
```

* **A Records (IPv4)**

  * Map the domain name (**jindra.bsa.**) to the IPv4 addresses **147.228.67.42** and **147.228.67.41**.
* **AAAA Record (IPv6)**

  * Maps the domain to the local IPv6 loopback address **::1** (typically for local testing).

---

### **Mail Server (MX) Records**

```plaintext
@         IN      MX           10   mail
@         IN      MX           20   mail.lubos.bsa.
```

* **MX Records**

  * Define the mail servers for this domain, along with their priority:
  * **Priority 10:** **mail** (assumed to be **mail.jindra.bsa.** due to the later A record)
  * **Priority 20:** **mail.lubos.bsa.** (lower priority, used if the primary is unavailable)

---

### **Aliases (CNAME) Records**

```plaintext
pop3      IN      CNAME             mail
smtp      IN      CNAME             mail.jindra.bsa.
imap      IN      CNAME             mail.jindra.bsa
```

* **CNAME (Canonical Name) Records**

  * **pop3** is an alias for **mail** (which will resolve to the IP in the **A** record).
  * **smtp** and **imap** are aliases for **mail.jindra.bsa.**, allowing multiple services to share the same server.

---

### **Additional Host Records**

```plaintext
ns        IN      A                 147.228.67.42
txt       IN      TXT               "ahoj svete"
```

* **A Record:**

  * Defines **ns.jindra.bsa.** as **147.228.67.42**, the primary nameserver for the domain.
* **TXT Record:**

  * A free-form text record, commonly used for verification, SPF, DKIM, or other metadata.
  * Here, it contains the simple message **"ahoj svete"** ("hello world" in Czech).

---

### **Summary of Services Defined:**

* **Web and General Services:** **147.228.67.42** and **147.228.67.41**
* **Mail Servers:** **mail.jindra.bsa.** (primary), **mail.lubos.bsa.** (secondary)
* **Nameservers:** **ns.jindra.bsa.**, **lubos.bsa.**
* **Aliases:** **pop3, smtp, imap**
* **IPv6 Loopback:** **::1** for testing
